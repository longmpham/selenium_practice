# IMGUR Image Scraper. 
Change your number of images, videos, gifs you can find with any type of search. 
- Change 'n' for number of searches in the search term
- change your search term for whatever you want to scrape
- change your username and passwords. Won't be able to scrape without one!!!
- IMPORTANT: if you have a docker, just adjust the driver but commenting out one or the other. You'll see in the code.
   - Note: make sure you adjust your port from your container in docker!
